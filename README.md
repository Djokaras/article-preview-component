## My process

I've started with mobile first approach. Mobile layout using flex, for desktop version I've used grid by spaning img element.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Similar challenge like previous ones. Practices layout for both mobile and desktop. I've reminded myself of grid and spanning.

### Continued development

Must practice more semantic HTML. Also I don't feel comfortable using grid and span in it, so I have to go back to my resources and strengthen that area.

### Useful resources

- [For practicing grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me with grid span, and I should revisit it.
